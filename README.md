# Fly By: Building an Interactive 3D Experience

## Overview

**Fly By** is a web-based 3D flight simulation game developed as a group minor project at the **School of Computer Engineering, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar**. The game allows players to explore an infinite, procedurally generated hexagonal landscape from a bird's perspective. Built using **Three.js** and optimized for web performance, the game leverages modern WebGL techniques, procedural content generation, and GPU-aware rendering strategies.

## Key Features

- Infinite procedurally generated terrain using Simplex noise.
- Adaptive rendering using InstancedMesh for grass, trees, and terrain tiles.
- Real-time asset loading and GPU-tier based optimizations.
- Smooth third-person and birdâ€™s-eye camera system with virtual joystick support.
- Flight controls with responsive animations and terrain collision avoidance.
- UI enhancements with animated loading screens, modal info windows, and background music.

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader)
- [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) for audio
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for UI animations
- [NippleJS](https://yoannmoi.net/nipplejs/) for virtual joystick
- [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) for optimized raycasting
